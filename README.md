# Yumi-robot-Rubik-s-cube
In this project any configuration of a 2x2 Rubikâ€™s cube was solved by an ABB IRB14000 Yumi robot. It was done by utilizing computer vision to scan the current layout of the cube, solve the cube with an algorithm, and execute the solution with Yumi. In an early stage of the project, an AI solver was tried but replaced with a Kociemba's algorithm when the necessary computing power could not be met.
